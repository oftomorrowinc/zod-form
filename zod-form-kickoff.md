# ZodForm - Claude Code Project Kickoff

We're building ZodForm, an opinionated form generation and validation library for Node.js applications powered by Zod schemas. This package will integrate perfectly with our HumanAgentChat component, providing dynamic form generation capabilities with a consistent dark theme and modern styling.

The core functionality of ZodForm is to transform Zod schemas into beautiful HTML forms with built-in validation, designed specifically for use with Express, HTMX, and Firebase. Rather than building a client-side heavy solution, ZodForm takes a server-rendered approach with HTMX enhancements for progressive functionality, making it lightweight and performant.

Key features include:
- Automatic HTML form generation from Zod schemas
- Dark-themed, responsive design that matches our HumanAgentChat component
- HTMX integration for real-time validation and partial page updates
- Express middleware for server-side validation
- Firestore integration for storing and retrieving form schemas
- Modal dialog support for displaying forms in overlay windows
- Rich set of form elements with appropriate mappings from Zod types
- Conditional field logic based on form values

ZodForm should be highly opinionated, focusing on simplicity and developer experience while maintaining flexibility for customization when needed. The library should work seamlessly in our Node.js, Express, HTMX, and Firebase environment without requiring any additional frameworks.

Please implement this based on the detailed specification in the ZodForm markdown document, focusing on creating a clean, efficient library that makes form generation and validation as painless as possible.
